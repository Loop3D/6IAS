Example Noddy Files					

This directory contains a simple set of example Noddy histories together 
with gravity and magnetic files and some pictures of block diagrams, maps 
& total field images, in windows .BMP format.

In many of the directories there will be three sets of models, which will 
contain the following code in the filename:

"3" a three layer system, middle layer high density/susceptibility
"lo" a two layer system, lower layer high density/susceptibility
"hi" a two layer system, higher layer high density/susceptibility

m20ofau: Vertical dyke with strike slip faults cutting it at 20 degrees
m45ofau: Vertical dyke with strike slip faults cutting it at 45 degrees

mfolds: Folds plunging at various angles to the north and south

minterf2: Irregular fold interference pattern
mintref1: Regular basin and dome fold interference patterns

mnorm2: Normal fault cutting horizontal sheets

mpopup1: Pop-up fault structure cutting horizontal sheets

mrev2a: 
mrev2b: Various reverse faults cutting horizontal sheets
mrev2c: 

mrevsh2c: Various normal shear zones cutting horizontal sheets

msciss1: Scissor fault cutting horizontal sheets
msciss2: Scissor fault cutting horizontal sheets

mvert: Folded vertical dyke
